      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p><strong>FlickPick</strong> is built for people who want quick, honest opinions about what to watch next. Whether you’re picking a film for a date night, a weekend binge, or just a quick distraction, our reviews are designed to save you time and help you make great choices.</p>
      <p>We focus on short, helpful reviews, usually under 100 words—so you get the gist without spoilers or fluff. Each movie includes a star rating, a one-sentence takeaway, and tags for genre and mood.</p>
      <p>This project was inspired by the idea that good recommendations don’t have to be long. We’re here to cut through the noise and give movie lovers (especially students and young adults) the information they need fast.</p>
